## 📖 Usage

### Importing Models

1. Open Blender.
2. Go to `File > Import`.
3. Choose the **Battleforge (.drs/.bmg)** file type.
4. Select your desired model file to import.

### Exporting Models

1. **Open Blender**  
   Launch Blender as you normally would.

2. **Import Battleforge Scene**  
   - Go to File > Import > New Battleforge Scene (no file selection needed).

3. **Choose Model Type & Collision**  
   - In the import panel, select:
     - **Model Type**: Static or Animated  
     - **Collision**: Box, Sphere, or Cylinder if required

4. **Create New Battleforge Scene**  
   - Click the **New Battleforge Scene** button.  
   - Blender generates a new Collection hierarchy.

5. **Organize Collections**  
   - (Optional) Delete the original `Collection` hierarchy.  
   - Work within the Battleforge collections.

6. **Rename Your Model Collection**  
   - In the Outliner, rename `DRSModel_object_CHANGENAME` to your model name.

7. **Add Meshes**  
   - Create/import meshes and move them into `Meshes_Collection`.

8. **Assign Materials**  
   - Switch to the Shading workspace.  
   - Open the Asset Browser and under Battleforge Asset Lib, drag-and-drop:
     - **ColNorPar** for Color, Normal, Parameter maps  
     - **ColNorParRef** to include Refraction map  
   - Ensure all wanted texture nodes feed into the **DRS Material** node.

9. **Generate Collision Shapes (optional)**  
   - Add a primitive (Box/Sphere/Cylinder), scale/position around your mesh, and put it inside the right sub-collection.

10. **Export to .drs**  
    - Select your model collection.  
    - Go to File > Export > Battleforge (.drs).  
    - Verify File Name and options:
      - Apply Transform (default)
      - Split Mesh by UV Islands (default)
      - Flip Normals (default): Sometimes your model appears to be inside-out, change this optio to fix it
      - Keep Debug Collection
      - Model Type: static/animated with/without collision
    - Click **Export DRS**.
